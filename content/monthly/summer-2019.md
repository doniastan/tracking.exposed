In the summer we were at our peak with people hired for ALEX project. This has proven to be quite an hard task, because we have to onboard the new collaborators, and be clear in our task specification.

* We have a new brand and style! It should be more organic and talking with people in the communication sector has proved valuable.
* We contribute to our first Datathon, organized with Berlin Data Science Social Good. Data scientists analyzed one year of fbtrex data. We did a privacy assessment and defined minimization and confidentiality agreement; the analysts worked as collaborators of the project, and we described restrictions in time, usage, and publication of such data. It is something that, ideally, might be enhanced by providing synthetic data and then applying the same code in our production database. They analyzed a copy of the year 2018 and here there is [the final presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cv967fdfSf96NCvN6h0H5ynvw9iEcV6S4gVetlH5MlM/edit). The analysis realized were pretty interesting, and a few participants stay in touch with TRex. Simply, what was hard is to integrate the scripts and tools developed in our analysis pipeline.
* YouTube analysis in the summer school has been great! Currently the site is under revision and the technology still demands stability, but as alpha it has produced [unique insights](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/results).
